###### Towards foundation model for viral diseases.
Viral diseases have had a significant global impact, affecting millions of people worldwide. Estimating the potential number of positive cases is crucial for controlling disease spread and allocating necessary resources effectively. However, in the early stages of an outbreak, limited data availability poses significant challenges for accurate estimation. Additionally, employing individual models for each disease in specific regions proves less efficient. This work aims to train a foundation model on viral diseases, enabling estimation of positive cases during outbreaks and for existing diseases. Several existing foundation models are trained on different datasets spanning various domains. These models cannot adapt to the specific characteristics of viral disease related data. These models operate in a channel-independent manner, thus failing to assess the interactions among different variables. Yet, variables such as the number of affected and vaccinated cases are pivotal in enhancing the results within the domain of viral diseases. This endeavor seeks to develop a domain-specific foundation model tailored specifically for viral diseases, adapted to the unique data characteristics.
